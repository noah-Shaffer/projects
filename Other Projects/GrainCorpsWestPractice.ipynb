    "Step-by-step explanation of calculating the fixed swap rate for freight swaps (no code):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the number of payment periods and accrual factor:**  \n",
    "   Determine how many payment periods (N) there are (e.g., quarterly payments means N=4) and the accrual factor per period (fraction of year each period represents, e.g., 0.25 for quarterly).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Obtain the floating freight rates for each period:**  \n",
    "   Have the expected floating rates (Findex) for each payment period, usually annualized rates quoted in $/ton.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set the annual discount rate:**  \n",
    "   Use the annual discount rate (r) representing the relevant interest rate environment for discounting future cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the discount factor for each payment date:**  \n",
    "   For each period, calculate how far in the future the payment is (in years), then compute the discount factor as the present value weight using continuous compounding:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   D_{t,T_i} = e^{-r \\times t_i}\n",
    "   $$  \n",
    "   where $$t_i$$ is the time to period $$i$$ in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate the present value (PV) of the floating leg:**  \n",
    "   Multiply each floating rate by its corresponding accrual factor and discount factor, then sum these across all periods:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   PV_{\\text{floating}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N F_{\\text{index}, i} \\times \\Delta_i \\times D_{t,T_i}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate the present value of the fixed leg accruals:**  \n",
    "   Sum the accrual factors discounted by the corresponding discount factors:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   PV_{\\text{fixed accrual}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta_i \\times D_{t,T_i}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Calculate the fixed swap rate:**  \n",
    "   Divide the floating leg PV by the discounted accrual sum to find the fair fixed rate that makes the swap value zero at inception:  \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   F_{\\text{fix}} = \\frac{PV_{\\text{floating}}}{PV_{\\text{fixed accrual}}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Interpret the fixed swap rate:**  \n",
    "   This rate represents the fixed freight cost per ton that balances expected floating payments discounted to present value, ensuring neither party has an initial advantage.\n",
